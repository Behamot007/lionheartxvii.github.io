                    Klara Marie Fassbinder was born in Trier on 15 February 1890 and grew up as the fifth of seven
                    children in a Catholic family loyal to the Kaiser. Nevertheless, the family of teachers was open to
                    social and political issues and six of the seven siblings pursued careers as teachers.<br>
                    Another reason for Klara Fassbinder to become a teacher was her quick comprehension skill,
                    which caused her to clash with other children and made her want to be a fair teacher for future
                    generations. Thus, at the age of 16, she enrolled in the Higher Teacher Training Seminar in
                    Koblenz and three years later she obtained her teaching diploma for middle and high schools for
                    girls. After another three years, during which she worked as a teacher in Darmstadt, she managed
                    to complete her external high school diploma in Prussian MÃ¼nster in 1913, which allowed her to
                    become one of the first female students at the University of Bonn. <br>
                    In 1917, she passed her state exam for higher education in French, German, history, and
                    philosophy and subsequently obtained a doctorate in Romance studies.

                <div class="text article-text">
                    Although Klara Fassbinder had a deep understanding of the French language, this did not reflect
                    her attitude towards the country. She held a negative attitude towards France, which led her to
                    voluntarily join the war effort in 1918 as an officer rank speaker, firmly convinced that Germany
                    would win the war.<br>
                    In the army, she was deployed to the Western Front in the French Ardennes to boost the troops'
                    morale. She provided "patriotic education", organized church concerts as well as discussion
                    evenings, and put together a small lending library.<br>
                    It was only when she was confronted with the suffering of the people at the front that protest
                    arose in her and her ideas changed abruptly. For she was also employed as a mediator between
                    the French population and the German occupying army. She was thus in direct contact with the
                    French population, which she got to know better and no longer recognised as the "hereditary
                    enemy".<br>
                    In the end, she changed from a determined nationalist to an advocate of Franco-German
                    friendship and pacifism. In retrospect, she often wondered how she could have been blind for so
                    long.

                <div class="line"></div>
                <div class="text article-text">
                    Before World War I, Klara Marie Fassbinder was convinced that it would be better not to
                    participate in politics and and women's suffrage did not seem to be an important issue for her
                    either. However, after returning from the war, the discussion became more prominent, until she
                    joined the women's movement at the International Women's Suffrage Congress in Paris in 1926.
                    At this congress, she was elected to the Peace Committee and has since been committed to
                    gender equality.<br>
                    After Konrad Adenauer aimed to rearm the Federal Republic from 1950 onwards, Fassbinder
                    joined the peace movement and campaigned for understanding with the East and for the
                    reunification of Germany. Due to her clear pacifist stance, she was spied on by the intelligence
                    service under the pretext of spreading pro-communist statements, and in 1953 a official
                    proceeding was opened against her. This was closed due to groundless accusations, but Klara
                    Fassbinder was suspended from her post and sent into early retirement on the instructions of the
                    then Minister of Education.<br>
                    Despite numerous hostilities, she continued to advocate for the peace movement and remained
                    tirelessly true to her values.

                <div class="text article-text">
                    After returning from World War I, Klara Marie Fassbinder actively worked towards reconciliation
                    with France and therefore decided to move to Saarland in 1920, which at that time was still under
                    French occupation. There, she taught at a school in SaarbrÃ¼cken and later became the head of the
                    "BÃ¼hnenvolksbund", an organization that aimed to make theatre more accessible to all social
                    classes.<br>
                    Due to her publicly critical attitude towards the Nazi Reich, she was dismissed without notice in
                    1935 after the Saarland was annexed by Germany. Contrary to the advice of her French friends,
                    she did not flee to neighbouring France but instead stayed in Germany to become the head of a
                    small Catholic school for girls. After it was closed, Fassbinder continued to give private lessons
                    and kept her head above water financially by translating Paul Claudel's works.<br>
                    However, when the war ended, she returned as headmistress to the girls' school and at the same
                    time became a professor of history at the Pedagogical Academy in Bonn. She placed particular
                    emphasis on analyzing recent events in order to teach her students how they came about and
                    how to prevent a recurrence.<br>
                    She taught there until her teaching license was revoked due to her clear political stance and she
                    was forcibly retired against her will. Despite numerous protests from her students, she was no
                    longer allowed to enter the university and was not granted a farewell lecture. However, this did
                    not stop her from giving her lecture "Schluss mit Deutschland" (engl. âNo more Germanyâ) in
                    front of 800 students in the university cafeteria in 1967.<br>
                    She was rehabilitated by the Minister of Education, Prof. Paul Luchtenberg, in 1957, which is
                    reflected in an acknowledgement in her retirement certificate.

                    In 1919, she was to be awarded with the Iron Cross, but she declined it as it no longer fit with her
                    pacifist worldview.<br>
                    Through her efforts for the German-French friendship and as a translator of Paul Claudel, she was
                    to be awarded the French "Ordre des Palmes AcadÃ©miques" in 1966. This is one of the highest
                    honours in France for achievements in education. However, the then Federal President of
                    Germany, Heinrich LÃ¼bke, forbade her from accepting the award, leading to a political scandal
                    and great attention. Only after Gustav Heinemann was appointed as the new President was she
                    able to accept the award.<br>
                    At the age of 84, Klara Marie Fassbinder died in a retirement home in Berkum near Bonn. One of
                    her last wishes was to be buried with the awarded order.
