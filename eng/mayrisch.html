                    Aline Mayrisch de Saint-Hubert was born on August 22, 1874 in Hollerich, Luxembourg, as the
                    daughter of Marie Élisabeth Julie Mongenast and the timber merchant Xavier de Saint-Hubert.<br>
                    After attending the secondary school "Sainte Sophie" in Luxembourg, she spent two years in
                    Bonn, where she was prepared for marriage and the lifestyle of a lady of the wealthy bourgeoisie
                    at the boarding school "Sartorius". Although she was considered gifted, intelligent and curious,
                    and above all had an interest in art, literature and science, she was not allowed to complete a
                    higher education degree, as access to higher education was denied to women.<br>
                    Eventually, at the age of twenty, she married the industrialist and businessman Émile Mayrisch,
                    who later became the director of the steel giant Arbed. With her husband, she moved to
                    Dudelange in southern Luxembourg and they had a son in 1899, who died at a young age. Two
                    years later, their daughter Andrée Mayrisch was born.<br>
                    In 1920, the family moved to Colpach and had their castle in Dudelange converted into a
                    children's home. At last in 1939, Aline Mayrisch moved to the south of France, to the town of
                    Cabris, where she passed away at the age of 72 in 1947.

                <div class="text article-text">
                    Aline Mayrisch was very involved in the social sector and founded numerous organizations for
                    various purposes.<br>
                    Her first organization was founded in 1906 together with other women, and thus the "Association
                    pour les Intérêts de la Femme" (engl. „League for the Defence of the Women's Interests“) was
                    established, which focused on helping women in need and promoting education for girls. In
                    addition, the organization helped finding jobs, legal protection for women and organized
                    numerous further education courses. In Luxembourg, this represented one of the first moments of
                    organized feminism.<br>
                    In order to advance educational equality in Luxembourg, Aline Mayrisch founded another
                    organization in 1909, which focused on the establishment of a girls' high school. In the same year,
                    the government approved the establishment, but on the condition that within three years they
                    had to prove that a secondary school for girls was indeed necessary. Thus, the "Lycée des Jeunes
                    Filles" was founded in Luxembourg City, which was attended by numerous middle-class girls.<br>
                    The project was approved despite protests in 1911 when a public financing of girls' schools was
                    voted for without opposition. This made it possible to put an end to the education crisis and
                    allowed women to attend university, enabling them to obtain an education equal to that of men.

                    Health care and charities were important interests of Aline Mayrisch, which led her to engage with
                    the "Ligue luxembourgeoise contre la tuberculose" (engl. "Luxembourg League against
                    Tuberculosis") and to promote the training of social workers. In addition, she supported the
                    development of the first daycare centre for children in Esch-sur-Alzette, which contributed to an
                    improvement in the everyday lives of women.
                    With the outbreak of the First World War, she set up a military hospital in Dudelange, where she
                    helped care for wounded soldiers from both sides of the war. After the war, she joined the Red
                    Cross and became increasingly involved in the organization after the sudden accidental death of
                    her husband, until she was elected president of the Luxembourg Red Cross in 1933. Furthermore,
                    she supported the creation of a modern maternity hospital and preventive care facilities for babies
                    and young children in Luxembourg.<br>
                    For her efforts in the healthcare sector, she received the Cross of Honour, one of the highest
                    honours in Luxembourg, awarded to her by the Grand Duchess Charlotte.<br>
                    When Aline Mayrisch passed away in 1947, she donated her castle in Colpach as well as a large
                    part of her fortune to the Luxembourg Red Cross, eventually transforming it into a recovery and
                    convalescence centre.

                    Aline Mayrisch was very interested in art and literature and used this to mediate between the
                    cultural circles of Germany and France. Since the reconciliation of both countries was important to
                    her and her husband, they invited numerous personalities to their castle in Colpach and thus
                    founded the "Comité franco-allemand" in 1917. Through this literary circle, a connection was to
                    be forged between personalities from the different nations in order to build an understanding for
                    each other.<br>
                    Especially in the period between the world wars, the meetings increased and intellectuals from
                    politics, business, art and literature came together in the castle. They would exchange their
                    different views and ideas with each other during meetings in the library, in the park or over a meal.
                    Many friendships were formed in the circle, reflecting Aline Mayrisch's idea of a pacifist and united
                    Europe.<br>
                    After the accidental death of her husband, she began to withdraw and spent the 1930s devoting
                    more time to literature and religious mysticism.

                    From a very young age Aline Mayrisch was interested in cultural as well as political topics, which is
                    why she began writing reports on German artists as well as book reviews in the Belgian magazine
                    "L'Art moderne" in 1898. Among her most famous reviews was her article on the work
                    "L'Immoraliste", which was written by her acquaintance André Gide.<br>
                    She also maintained friendships with many important writers from France, Luxembourg, Belgium
                    and Germany and corresponded with many of them. While she advocated for uncompromising art
                    with Edmond Picard and Emile Verhaeren, she also provided financial support to Thomas Mann in
                    the 1930s, who published his magazine "Mass und Wert" from exile.<br>
                    During her trip to Japan in 1934, she sought religious meaning and became increasingly
                    interested in Buddhism. Therefore, in her later life, Mayrisch turned more to religious mysticism
                    and, together with Marie Delcourt and Bernhard Groethuysen, translated various texts, including
                    the sermons of the medieval mystic Master Eckhart.

                    The pictures show photographs and postcards that Aline Mayrisch brought back from her trip to

                    modernity and tradition.<br>
