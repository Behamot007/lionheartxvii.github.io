                <h3>Liability for content</h3>
                <p>As a service provider, the operator of these pages is responsible for its own content in accordance with ยง 7 para. 1 TMG
                    for its own content in accordance with the general laws. However, according to ยง 8 to 10 TMG, there is no obligation 
                    to monitor or research circumstances that indicate illegal activity with regard to transmitted or stored third-party 
                    information. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. 
                    However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. 
                    As soon as such infringements become known, the content will be removed immediately.
                </p>

                <h3>Liability for links</h3>
                <p>The offer contains links to external websites of third parties, the contents of which cannot be influenced. 
                    Therefore, no liability can be assumed for these external contents. The respective provider or operator is 
                    always responsible for the content of the linked pages. At the time of linking, the linked pages were checked 
                    for possible legal violations, but no illegal content was found. A permanent control of the contents of the 
                    linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a violation of the law. If any infringements 
                    of the law become known, the corresponding links will be removed immediately.
                </p>
